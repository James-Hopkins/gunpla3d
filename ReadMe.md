## Gunpla3D.com Community Orientated Site For Viewing Gunpla

---

I created this site Gunpla3d.com with the intention of adding as many gunpla as I can with a 3Desque view to help beginners(like me) make decisions on which kits to buy / build.

If anyone would like to contribute pictures of their gunpla to the site I can credit you on there and link to your personal site or social media because this will be a bit of work - taking many pictures while rotating the gunpla.

I'd like community feedback on the site and recommendations on what features it could use or any other conntent that could be linked on each gunpla page. It's very much a demonstration site ATM but has the basic idea is there, I'd like to spend the next while just getting content for the site before adding more complex features but I'm open to any ideas.

An additional pain point I had was taking the actual photos I used a green screen fabric as a background so I could chroma key it out but it had fold marks and the color was not consistent because of this. On top of the green screen issues just rotating the gunpla was tough due to it falling at times and inconsitencies in angles. I have pre ordered a gunpla which should arrive in the coming months which has a base to make this easier. Any tips for this would be appreciated as well.

The attached photo is my build, i'd like to panel line it but before I do a few tutorial videos would be needed as i'm worried I'll mess it up.
If you think this a good idea feel free to comment / upvote.
